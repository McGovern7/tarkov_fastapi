# Tarkov Storage App using FastAPI
A solo project building a FastAPI app to interact with Tarkov SQL data

## APP DESCRIPTION
This app provides a space for players of the game Escape from Tarkov to store the ammo they have found, and view the ammo's advance data. The storage tab can be accessed after registering an account and loggin in.

## BUILD
The site will be hosted in conjunction with my Portfolio using WordPress

## Writeup
In today's rapidly evolving and competitive tech landscape, full-stack development has become an essential skill for developers. Full-stack development is a multi-discipline skill, requiring devs to have an end-to-end understanding of an application. This comprehensive knowledge enables efficient problem-solving and can lead to a more robust application architecture. For example, a full-stack dev assigned to the frontend can leverage their insights of backend processes to optimize how frontend components interact with server-side logic. These devs can streamline queries, robustly handle bad requests, and minimize server data load—improving both performance and user experience.

When creating applications prior to this project, I was primarily assigned roles localized within the frontend or backend of an application. While this specialization allowed for expertise of roles, it limited my understanding of the app’s overall architecture. With this project, my goal is to gain a comprehensive view of the entire application stack.

I have successfully taught myself the various software disciplines necessary to build my first web application as a solo full-stack developer. Made high in demand by today's devs, this project's stack comprises the following tools.

## Onboarded Skills
- Starting from almost no background, I have built a web api which is asynchronous, multi-port capable, well documented, secured, and efficient
- For future projects, I can develop more complex api techniques within the ever-growing FastAPI web framework.
- With additional built-in packages, I can easily scale my app with features like caching, load balancing, rate limiting, and automated backups.
- Having never used React prior to this, I have created a modular, scalable, and accessible app. This app is much more complex than anything I have built in the past, even apps I created in a group
- I can jump-start future web apps with the components I created for this project (Button, Navbar, Sidebar, etc)
 - Given React’s wealth of libraries, tools, and extensions, there are always new techniques I can and implement.
